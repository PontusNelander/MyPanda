    <h1>Giant Panda</h1>

<p>
    The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo), also known as giant panda or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China.
</p> 

<p>
    It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.

<p>
    The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.    
</p> 

<p>
    Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
